Love Vuex but have to use Angular?  Need a state management framework that is easy to reason about?

This repo shows how the [Angular Model Extension](https://tomastrajan.github.io/angular-model-pattern-example#/about) Todo example can be turned into a Vuex-like state management pattern.

[Run it on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-extensions-model-dnaef9)

Please [ping me](https://drew-simmons.grapedrop.com/) and let me know how you are using this and/or how it can be improved.

Thanks!
Drew
